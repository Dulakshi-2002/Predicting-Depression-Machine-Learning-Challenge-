# Predicting Depression - Machine Learning Challenge

This project aims to predict depression using various machine learning techniques. The dataset is provided by a Kaggle competition.

## Project Structure

```
predicting-depression-new-model.ipynb
README.md
```

## Files

- **predicting-depression-new-model.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook predicting-depression-new-model.ipynb
    ```

3. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code.

## Notebook Contents

1. **Importing Necessary Libraries**: Importing libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, XGBoost, and others.
2. **Loading the Datasets**: Loading the training and test datasets.
3. **Checking the Data**: Exploring the data, checking for unique values, data types, duplicates, and visualizing distributions.
4. **Handling Data Issues**: Cleaning and standardizing data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
5. **Data Preprocessing**: Dropping irrelevant columns, filling missing values, and scaling numerical features.
6. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features, binning continuous variables, and scaling features.
7. **Model Preparation**: Splitting the data into training and validation sets.
8. **Training & Evaluating the Model**: Training an XGBoost model and evaluating its performance on the validation set.
9. **Making Predictions & Submission**: Making predictions on the test set and preparing the submission file.
